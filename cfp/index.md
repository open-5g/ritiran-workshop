**Call for Papers**

The First Workshop on Research and Innovation in Testing and Integration for Open Radio Access Networks (RitiRAN), co-located with VTC Fall 2024 in Washington, DC, will bring together researchers from academia, industry, and government with the goal of advancing the state of the art on testing and integration for Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) systems. We encourage the submission of papers and demos on new results and techniques aimed at achieving true interoperability in Open RAN, including testing of disaggregated RAN components, RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs), and of data-driven RAN optimization solutions with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The workshop represents an opportunity to network and share results across various initiatives in the Open RAN testing research and development space, including the projects that are part of the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund (PWSCIF) and O-RAN ALLIANCE Open Testing and Integration Centers (OTICs) and PlugFests. The technical paper presentations and demos will be interleaved with one or two keynotes/invited talks from thought leaders in industry and academia, and a panel discussion on challenges and lessons learned in establishing Open RAN testing activities in OTICs and beyond. The participants will also be encouraged to contribute hands-on demonstrations in a dedicated session and to share open-source artifacts. Selected papers will be invited for a fast-track extended submission to a special issue of Elsevier Computer Networks.


The RitiRAN workshop welcomes original, previously unpublished contributions on research and development of new solutions and strategies for the testing and integration in Open RAN systems, including but not limited to:

- Profiling and testing of Massive MIMO Radio Units (RUs)
- Profiling and testing of the O-RAN Fronthaul interface, including different RU categories, ULPI enhancements, and transport solutions for the O-RAN fronthaul
- Integration and/or testing of disaggregated RAN components, including CUs, DUs, RUs, and their interfaces
- Automation for testing and integration
- Innovative solutions for end-to-end testing
- Techniques and best practices for repeatable and consistent testing
- Evaluation and profiling of the energy efficiency of Open RAN systems and of softwarized cellular networks
- Development of testing and/or integration procedures for multi-vendor, interoperable Open RAN systems
- Testing of RICs, xApps, rApps, and of RAN control solutions based on AI and ML
- Using digital twins for RAN testing 
- Integration challenges across multi-vendor environments
- Operating and bootstrapping Open Testing and Integration Centers
- Challenges in testing and/or integration for Open RAN systems
- Leveraging AI/ML for testing
- Testing automation for Open RAN systems

Papers should contain original material and not be previously published or currently submitted for consideration elsewhere. All submissions will be judged by their technical merit and relevance to the workshop, based on reviews by the Technical Program Committee. Submission of papers with open-source artifacts and demos is encouraged.

Manuscripts must be submitted by using [TrackChair](https://vtc2024f-rr-wks.trackchair.com/track/2305). Prospective authors are encouraged to submit a single PDF file with all fonts embedded, using the IEEE conference proceedings format (use the same PDF formatting guidelines as the main conference). Paper length is limited to five (5) pages (in two-column, 10-point format), all-inclusive (references, figures, etc.). Papers must include author names and affiliations for single-blind peer reviewing by the program committee. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers in-person at the workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the RitiRAN workshop proceedings and will be archived on IEEExplore. 

**Important Dates:**
- Workshop paper submission due: 1 July 2024
- Workshop paper acceptance notification: 22 August 2024
- Final paper submission: 5 September 2024
- Workshop: October 7th, 2024
